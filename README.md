📊 Historical Analysis of Chilean Pension Fund A (AFP System)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the historical evolution of Pension Fund A within the Chilean AFP system. The objective is to consolidate fragmented historical datasets, clean structural inconsistencies, and compare performance across active pension fund administrators.

The analysis focuses on long-term trends, volatility patterns, and comparative behavior among AFPs.

📚 Context

Chile’s pension system is based on individual capitalization accounts managed by private pension fund administrators (AFPs). Each administrator offers five funds (A to E), categorized by risk exposure.

Fund A represents the highest risk level, with the largest exposure to equities and therefore higher volatility.
